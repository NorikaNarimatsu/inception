Containers vs Images
instace vs class
Images: Think of an image like a blueprint, recipe, or a class in programming.
Containers: A container is a running instance of an image—like an object created from a class.

Docker-compose.yml?
Config file that lets you define and run multiple containers as one unit.
-> docker-compose up -d --build in Makefile will do:
    1. Builds 3 images (one per service) from your custom Dockerfiles
    2. Creates and runs 3 containers
    3. Makes sure they auto-restart if they fail

Order of Makefile
- Reads the `Dockerfile`
- Pulls the base image (`debian:bullseye`)
- Packages up your instructions (in this case: `CMD [”sleep”, “infinity”]`)
- Outputs a new image (e.g., `srcs-mariadb`, `srcs-nginx`, etc.)

COMMAND:
- docker ps 
-> to Lists all running containers.
- docker ps -a 
-> to Lists all containers, including stopped ones, with their status (exited/running).

- docker network ls
- docker network inspect inception

docker volume ls
docker volume inspect mariadb_data
