Containers vs Images
instace vs class
Images: Think of an image like a blueprint, recipe, or a class in programming.
Containers: A container is a running instance of an imageâ€”like an object created from a class.

Docker-compose.yml?
Config file that lets you define and run multiple containers as one unit.
-> docker-compose up -d --build in Makefile will do:
    1. Builds 3 images (one per service) from your custom Dockerfiles
    2. Creates and runs 3 containers
    3. Makes sure they auto-restart if they fail
